Key Features:

Mode Selection: Choose between three different modes: Pomodoro (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes).
Timer Display: View the current time remaining in the selected mode, counting down from the chosen time to zero.
Control Buttons:
Start Button: Initiates the timer countdown. Once started, the button hides to prevent accidental clicks.
Pause Button: Pauses the timer countdown. Clicking it again resumes the countdown.
Reset Button: Resets the timer to the initial time for the selected mode.
